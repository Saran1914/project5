       <p>themes are the story's focal point.Shanaya, Siddharth, and Mishti are portrayed in a remarkably realistic manner.</p>

    <b><p>Each chapter begins with an insightful quotation. There are a few places where I felt the plot was bogged down by</p>
       <p>too much description, but overall, the story runs well.Other than that, it was an enjoyable read. Numerous emotions</p>
       <p>permeate the plot, including love, rejection, sympathy, pity, etc. There is also evidence of a new friendship, </p>
       <p>the loss of family members, and trust concerns.</p></b><br>
